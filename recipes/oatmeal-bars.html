    <p>The best of both worlds! If you like lemon bars and oatmeal cookies, this will satisfy both cravings at once. The hint of almond along with these other flavors, builds a light and fresh flavor that no other lemon bar has.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can condensed milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Mix brown sugar and butter in a large bowl until combined. Mix flour, oats, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to butter mixture and mix until combined. Press half of the oat mixture in the bottom of the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While crust is baking, mix condensed milk, lemon juice, lemon extract, and almond extract in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour lemon mixture over the baked crust and spread evenly. Top with remaining oat mixture and gently pat into lemon mixture.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until filling has set and top crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Place in the refrigerator until chilled, about 2 hours. Cut into 16 bars.</li>
    </ol>
